# Ableton-Theme-Converter---Live-12-to-Live-10
Slightly homemade solution to the problem of no platforms allowing the user to make custom themes for Live 10. This software reads any Live 12 formatted theme and creates a clone formatted to Live 10. 

The only issues with this program are that some tags from Live 12 format do not exist in Live 10 format and vice versa. As a counter to this, the user has been given options to either replace all missing fields with the most common colour, allow the software to try to link tags that may be similar and fill in the rest with the common colour, or allows the user to enter custom colours for each missing tag.
